# AbstractFacialViewer
An augmented reality application designed to aid therapeutic sessions to help an individual with high functioning autism(HFA) recognize and interpret non-verbal facial cues.

In coming up with this project a team member suggested tackling the problem of creating an AR experience that could aid individuals to understand non-verbal facial cues. The reason behind their decision is because they have a sibling who was diagnosed with high functioning autism and have problems communicating and maintain friendships due to the inability to recognize nonverbal facial cues. So as a team we decided to join hands to make an application that could not only help our teammateâ€™s sibling but to also help all the other people who struggle with this problem.

As a team, we decided to run a qualitative investigation to study how AR can aid an individual with HFA to understand nonverbal facial cues in a social context.
